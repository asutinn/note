MAKEFILES
Makefiles to be read on every invocation of make.
See Section 3.4 [The Variable MAKEFILES], page 14.

VPATH
Directory search path for files not found in the current directory.
See Section 4.4.1 [VPATH Search Path for All Prerequisites], page 25.

SHELL
The name of the system default command interpreter, usually /bin/sh. You
can set SHELL in the makefile to change the shell used to run recipes. See
Section 5.3 [Recipe Execution], page 44. The SHELL variable is handled specially
when importing from and exporting to the environment. See Section 5.3.2
[Choosing the Shell], page 45.

MAKESHELL
On MS-DOS only, the name of the command interpreter that is to be used by
make. This value takes precedence over the value of SHELL. See Section 5.3
[MAKESHELL variable], page 44.

MAKE
The name with which make was invoked. Using this variable in recipes has
special meaning. See Section 5.7.1 [How the MAKE Variable Works], page 51.

MAKE_VERSION
The built-in variable ‘MAKE_VERSION’ expands to the version number of the
GNU make program.

MAKE_HOST
The built-in variable ‘MAKE_HOST’ expands to a string representing the host that
GNU make was built to run on.

MAKELEVEL
The number of levels of recursion (sub-makes).
See Section 5.7.2 [Variables/Recursion], page 52.

MAKEFLAGS
The flags given to make. You can set this in the environment or a makefile to
set flags.
See Section 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make], page 53.
It is never appropriate to use MAKEFLAGS directly in a recipe line: its contents
may not be quoted correctly for use in the shell. Always allow recursive make’s
to obtain these values through the environment from its parent.

GNUMAKEFLAGS
Other flags parsed by make. You can set this in the environment or a makefile
to set make command-line flags. GNU make never sets this variable itself. This
variable is only needed if you’d like to set GNU make-specific flags in a POSIXcompliant
makefile. This variable will be seen by GNU make and ignored by
other make implementations. It’s not needed if you only use GNU make; just use
MAKEFLAGS directly. See Section 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make],
page 53.

MAKECMDGOALS
The targets given to make on the command line. Setting this variable has no
effect on the operation of make.
See Section 9.2 [Arguments to Specify the Goals], page 99.

CURDIR
Set to the absolute pathname of the current working directory (after all -C options
are processed, if any). Setting this variable has no effect on the operation
of make.
See Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 50.

SUFFIXES
The default list of suffixes before make reads any makefiles.
.LIBPATTERNS
Defines the naming of the libraries make searches for, and their order.
See Section 4.4.6 [Directory Search for Link Libraries], page 28.
