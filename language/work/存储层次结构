device memory hierarchy

一般的智能设备，都会根据存储单元与CPU结合的紧密程度划分存储层次结构。

P1988
The device memory hierarchy includes four levels:
• L1 is internal to the CPUs. It concerns data exchange with the internal Level1 cache memory
subsystem, and it is the closest memory to the microprocessor unit (MPU) core and the IVA2.2 core.
• L2 is included in the IVA2.2 subsystem and the MPU subsystem.
• The chip-level interconnect consists of one L3 interconnect and four L4 interconnects. It enables
communication among the modules and subsystems in the device.
Figure 9-1 shows an overview of the L3 and L4 interconnect architecture.
• L3 handles many types of data transfers, especially exchanges with system-on-chip/external
memories. L3 transfers data with a maximum width of 64 bits from the initiator to the target. The L3
interconnect is a little-endian platform
• L4 is composed of the L4-Core, L4-Per, L4-Wakeup, and L4-Emu interconnects and handles data
transfers to peripherals. It supports 32-bit data width transfer and is optimized to support the
interconnection of many peripheral targets. These backplanes assume little-endian transactions for
narrower targets (8-bit, 16-bit) when doing data packing and unpacking.
