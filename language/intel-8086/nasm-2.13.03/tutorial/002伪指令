	伪指令不是真正的x86机器指令，

Pseudo−instructions are things which, though not real x86 machine instructions, are used in the
instruction field anyway because that’s the most convenient place to put them. The current
pseudo−instructions are DB, DW, DD, DQ, DT, DO, DY and DZ; their uninitialized counterparts RESB,
RESW, RESD, RESQ, REST, RESO, RESY and RESZ; the INCBIN command, the EQU command, and
the TIMES prefix.
