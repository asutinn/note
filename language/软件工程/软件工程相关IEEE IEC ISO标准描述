IEEE 12207用于描述软件的

This International Standard establishes a common process framework for describing the life cycle of man-made systems. It defines a set of processes and associated terminology for the full life cycle, including conception, development, production, utilization, support and retirement. This standard also supports the definition, control, assessment, and improvement of these processes. These processes can be applied concurrently, iteratively, and recursively to a system and its elements throughout the life cycle of a system.
