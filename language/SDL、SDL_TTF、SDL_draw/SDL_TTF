	SDL_ttf is a TrueType font rendering library that is used with the SDL 
library, and almost as portable. It depends on freetype2 to handle the TrueType 
font data. It allows a programmer to use multiple TrueType fonts without having 
to code a font rendering routine themselves. With the power of outline fonts and 
antialiasing, high quality text output can be obtained without much effort.
